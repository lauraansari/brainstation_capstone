This is my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science programe.

Problem statement: It is estimated that 90% of the world's population live in places with bad air quality. Poor air quality has adverse health affects on human, which means lower life quality and expectancy, and higher healthcare costs. Establishing a model that provides accurate forecasts could improve awereness and engagement with the topic, which in turn could help facilitate a change for the better. This is especially true for sensitive groups, i.e. children, elderly, and people with pre-excisting lung and heart conditions. These groups are at a higher risk of adverse health effects even at less harmful levels of bad air quality. This project tries to provide a solution to these high-risk groups to empower them minimize their risk to bad air quality by providing accurate forecasts and allow them to plan their outdoor time accordingly.

To maximize potential reach and get this project off the ground, a location with a high public interest in the topic is chosen: 45% of residents in Los Angeles think that air quality is a 'big problem'. Moreover, the region has been ranked as the 4th most polluted city in the US, therefore improvement measures would be highly beneficial.

Expected impact: An estimated 5% increase in public engagement and awereness could boost inidividual willingness to intervene and improve the situation. Increased awereness could also help vulnerable groups to plan ahead and make informed lifestyle decisions (e.g. adjusting or avoiding outdoor activities at certain times) based on the time of the year/month, which could decrease their exposure to dangerous levels of air quality by an estimated 2%. The final model could easily be integrated with existing outdoor planning apps, such as hiking planners, and holidays planning apps. Such an integration would provide a quick access to an accuerate forecast to both higher-risk groups and the general population, and would help reduce their exposure to dangerous levels of air quality.
